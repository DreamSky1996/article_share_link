     With summer coming, the coastal walk can get pretty crowded. To steer clear of crowds and maintain social distancing, we've found five lesser-known areas for you to put one foot in front of the other.

      Take the stairs
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If you've spent anytime in Coogee, you're well aware of how hilly it is. Regular exercisers are familiar with the South Coogee stairs near Cairo Street, but they can get crowded. Yet just further south is another (albeit not as long) set of stairs that you can tackle with fewer crowds. Find the top of them at Denning Street, across from Garie Place, then head down where you'll connect onto Wisdom Street. Then, turn right onto Crana Ave, then back up Pearce Street to connect back to Denning Street. No matter which way you do the loop, you'll be going up hill at one point or another!
